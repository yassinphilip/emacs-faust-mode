## faust-mode
Major mode for editing
[Faust](http://faust.grame.fr) (Functional AUdio STream) files.

Syntax highlighting of *all* the Faust commands and operators, as
well as indentation rules.

In addition to any hooks its parent mode `prog-mode` might have run,
this mode runs the hook `faust-mode-hook`, as the final step
during initialization.
